<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/iphone.jpg"><img src="http://www.appsandscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/iphone-300x225.jpg" alt="caption id=&quot;attachment_23&quot; align=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; caption=&quot;Image: Salvatore Vuono / FreeDigitalPhotos.net&quot;" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The first question that I had when I started with iPhone/iPad app development was what hardware was necessary for the job. Could I develop my apps on Windows or, even better, could I do it using my Linux machine? And would I need to buy an iPad in addition to the iPhone that I already owned?</p>

<p>After I did a lot of of research these are the answers that I found:</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>You need an Intel-based Mac. The alternatives are for the adventurous</h3>

<p>If you google &#8220;hardware for iPhone development&#8221; you will find that the only hardware that is <em>sanctioned</em> by Apple to develop apps is an Intel-based Macintosh. That means that Apple does not make Windows or Linux versions of XCode, its integrated development environment (IDE) that is used for app development.</p>

<p>Given that I have been a Linux and Windows user for years, I thought that there must have been some alternatives for these operating systems. So I some did extensive research, and here&#8217;s the bottom line: <strong>In order to focus my energy on developing applications, and not on troubleshooting operating system issues, I needed an Intel-based Mac</strong>.</p>

<p>If you cannot afford to buy an Intel-based Mac however, there are a few alternatives. Here are the two about which I have learned a little bit about:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>If you are NOT interested in submitting your applications to the Apple app store, you don&#8217;t need XCode</strong>. In that case, you can compile and debug your apps with an alternative IDE, test them on a jailbroken iPhone, and submit them to Cydia, a repository of applications for jailbroken iPhones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you are interested in submitting your applications to the Apple app store, you need XCode, and the Mac operating system (Mac OS)</strong>. It is possible to install the Mac OS on non-Apple hardware, by using one of the following two methods, neither of which is sanctioned by Apple:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* You can put together a Hackintosh, a non-Apple computer that runs Mac OS. Only certain non-Apple computers can be "converted" into Hackintoshes.


* You can patch the commercial software VMware Workstation, and obtain a modified installation disk of Mac OS. Both actions may be legally questionable. But if you
</code></pre>

<p>choose to go that route, the non-Apple hardware and the host operating system (Windows or Linux) must supports virtualization.</p>

<h3>You need to choose your Intel-based Mac carefully</h3>

<p>You may consider buying a used Mac to save some money. That was my first thought when I found out the price of new Macs. But you have to be careful. You should make sure that the used computer runs the latest version of the operating system. The reason is that Apple has a &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; attitude towards its app store and tightly controls app development. For instance, Apple makes the latest version of XCode run on only the latest two versions of Mac OS; And you do want the latest version of XCode because each new version makes app development easier.</p>

<p>You should also be careful about the size of the hard disk of your Mac. Flash-based disks are much faster than conventional ones but they are also much smaller for the price. If you are considering using your Mac as your main computer, you may need some additional space on your hard disk.</p>

<h3>You need to have have an iPhone and/or an iPad</h3>

<p>Although XCode comes with a iPhone/iPad simulator, it is extremely useful to have the actual iOS devices to test your applications on. If you are planning to develop apps for only the iPhone or only for the iPad, you don&#8217;t need to have both.</p>

<h3>Relax and enjoy Apple&#8217;s tight control of app development</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, Apple tightly controls the hardware and the software that is necessary to develop apps for its mobile devices. In addition, not all apps that have been developed on Apple&#8217;s hardware and with Apple&#8217;s software are approved by Apple. It turns out for an app to get approved it has to follow strict guidelines for design and architecture.</p>

<p>Such control however, come with some advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Apple is making available its innovative software development products to those who follow the company&#8217;s strict guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>If your app is approved, there is very little that you have to do to market it. Apple does all the work for you, and the users will chose it if it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p></li>
<li><p>iPhone and iPad users already trust Apple to approve useful and beautiful apps. Therefore users are more willing to invest on such apps.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, I have not been able to find anyone who claims to have developed an iPhone/iPad application by using a method that is not sanctioned by Apple.</p>

<p>So after a lot of thought and research, I begrudgingly bought a Mac. My Mac has now become my main work computer and because its operating system is based on Unix BSD, my transition from Linux has been very smooth. And, I almost hate to say it, I like my new Mac.</p>

<p><em>Have you developed apps that are featured in the App store without Apple&#8217;s sanctioned hardware and software? If yes, please share your experience in the comments.</em></p>
