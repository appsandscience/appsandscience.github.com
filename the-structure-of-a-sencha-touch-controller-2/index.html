<div class="entry-content"><p>In the past three blog posts, I used the CityBars Sencha Touch application, to</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/making-sense-of-sencha-touch-the-citybars-app-views/">to define a few terms used in Sencha Touch development</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/the-structure-of-a-sencha-touch-application/">to explain the structure of a Sencha Touch application</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/how-to-write-code-for-the-views-in-sencha-touch/">to demonstrate how the code for the graphical user interface is generated.</a></li>
</ol>


<p>In this post I will describe how the application</p>

<ol>
<li>finds the user&#8217;s location,</li>
<li>searches Yelp for bars near the user, and</li>
<li>responds when the user taps on a with the bar that the user is interested in.</li>
</ol>


<p>All this logic is contained in a <em>controller</em> JavaScript file, under the controller subdirectory. The rest of this blog post will explain the various parts of the code in the controller file.</p>

<h3>How References and Controls work in the Controllers of Sencha Touch</h3>

<p>To be able to read the values of some interface elements, and to set or manipulate them, the controller needs a reference to them. Each reference within the controller is defined as a pair. For instance the list of bars in the ListContainer, has an id of <em>#datalist</em> (see <a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/how-to-write-code-for-the-views-in-sencha-touch/">my previous blog post</a> for a description of the views of the application.) This list of bars is referred to by the controller as dataList. The exact syntax is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('CityBars.controller.Business', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',

config: {
    refs: {
        dataList: '#dataList',
        listCard: '#listCard',
        mainNav: 'mainnav',
        detailCard: '#detailCard'
    },

    control: {
        "#dataList": {
            itemtap: 'onListItemTap'
        }
    }
},
</code></pre>

<p>In the code snippet above, the first line is used to define the controller&#8217;s name (Business) and to declare it as a controller, as opposed to a view, for instance. The config part of the code has two parts. The <em>refs</em> part that I referred to above and the control part, that I will explain in a bit. Notice the four of references.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first assigns the name <strong>dataList</strong> to the list component with id <strong>#datalist</strong> (note the # character).</li>
<li>The second assigns the name <strong>listCard</strong> to the list card for each bar, a card that has the id <strong>#listCard</strong> in the ListContainer.js file.</li>
<li>The third assings the name <strong>mainNav</strong> to the navigation panel <strong>mainav</strong> which is the navigation panel in the <em>MainNav.js</em>. Because the controller refers to the navigation view as a whole, no # is used before the name <strong>mainnav</strong>.</li>
<li>Similarly, the element with id <strong>#detailCard</strong> gets a reference <strong>detailCard</strong> in the controller.</li>
</ol>


<p>The controller can now refer to the four elements above and get their values or properties with function that Sencha Touch has implemented. These functions are called getters. For the <strong>datalist</strong> reference though, the application would like to respond when the user taps on it. For that reason a control needs to be defined. More specifically, the event that the controller is waiting for is <strong>itemtap</strong>. As soon as this event occurs, the function <strong>onListItemTap</strong> is executed. That function has to be defined by the user later on in the controller.</p>

<p>Now that the references and the controllers are set, the logic of the application has to be specified. But before any logic is introduced to respond to the tapping of an item, the application has to be able to find the user&#8217;s location and to find nearby bars.</p>

<h3>How Sencha Touch finds the user&#8217;s location</h3>

<p>Sencha Touch contains a few utilities that access the information that a phone can supply. In the case of geolocation, Sencha Touch uses <em>Ext.util.Geolocation</em>. The function to get the user&#8217;s location is called <strong>getLocation</strong> in this application, and it is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>getLocation: function(callback) {
    if (navigator &amp;&amp; navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
            callback(position);
        }, function(error) {
            alert('You are not connected to the Internet');
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The function above checks whether the user is connected to the internet, and if yes, it returns the user&#8217;s latitude and longitude.</p>

<h3>How Sencha Touch finds businesses near the user</h3>

<p>With the user&#8217;s location known, the application connects to Yelp and pulls that information. In order for this to happen however, the application needs to know the type of information that is going to be returned by Yelp, as well as the names of the fields that are returned. The information about the type of connection with Yelp is encapsulated in a Sencha Touch <strong>Store</strong> and the fields in a Sencha Touch <strong>Model</strong>. Models and stores go together, but let&#8217;s start with the store.</p>

<h4>The structure of a Sencha Touch Store</h4>

<p>The information about a store is kept in a file under the <em>store</em> directory. The contents of that file are shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('CityBars.store.BusinessStore', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Store',
    requires: [
        'CityBars.model.Business'
    ],

config: {
    model: 'CityBars.model.Business',
    storeId: 'BusinessStore',
    proxy: {
        type: 'jsonp',
        reader: {
            type: 'json',
            rootProperty: 'businesses'
        }
    }
}
});
</code></pre>

<p>First, the store is given a name <em>BusinessStore</em> and declared as a store. Because the store always corresponds to a model, this is declared with the requires statemement. The store is configured with the model that it is related to, an id is given to it for easy referencing, and information about the connection is displayed in the reader statement. Because the information is pulled from an external website (Yelp,) the type of the store is <strong>jsonp</strong>. Because the information is returned from Yelp as a JSON file, the reader of the file is of <strong>json</strong> type, and only everything under the <strong>businesses</strong> property is read.</p>

<h4>The structure of a Sencha Touch Model</h4>

<p>The information about a model is kept in a JavaScript file under the <em>model</em> directory. The contents of the file are shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('CityBars.model.Business', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
    config: {
        fields: [
            {
                name: 'id',
                type: 'int'
            },
            {
                name: 'name'
            },
            {
                name: 'latitude'
            },
            {
                name: 'longitude'
            },
            {
                name: 'address1'
            },
            {
                name: 'address2'
            },
            {
                name: 'address3'
            },
            {
                name: 'phone'
            },
            {
                name: 'state_code'
            },
            {
                name: 'mobile_url'
            },
            {
                name: 'rating_img_url_small'
            },
            {
                name: 'photo_url'
            }
        ]
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This model is given a name, <em>Business</em>, and it is declared as a model. Then the fields served by the JSON file are described. They are id, name, latitude, longitude, etc. Those fields can be found on Yelp&#8217;s website.</p>

<h4>The init function in a Sencha Touch Controller</h4>

<p>Now that the model and the store for the application have been defined, the controller, can perform a search and serve the information to the user. This is done with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>init: function() {
    this.getLocation(function (location) {
        this.getBusinesses(location, function (store) {
            this.getDataList().setStore(store);
        });
    });
},
</code></pre>

<p>In the few lines of code above, a lot of logic for the application is contained. First, the function that is defined in the above lines is run when the controller is initialized, and that is as soon as the application launches. Each line after the first starts with <strong>this</strong>, a shortcut to the current controller. In other words, when the controller initializes, the <strong>getLocation</strong> function contained in the same file is run, then the <strong>getLocation</strong> function is run and finally the store for the <strong>dataList</strong> defined above is set to the store that was also defined above. With the sequence of these steps, the initial list of the application is populated with entries, and the controller is ready to respond to the user&#8217;s taps.</p>

<h3>How a Sencha Touch Controller responds to a user&#8217;s tap</h3>

<p>The function executed when a list item is tapped is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>onListItemTap: function(dataview, index, target, record, e, options) {
    if (record) {

    if (!this.details) {
        this.details = Ext.create('CityBars.view.DetailPanel', {
            title: 'Details'
        });
    }

    var map = this.details.child('#detailMap');
    map.setMapOptions({
        zoom: 17
    });
    map.setMapCenter({
        latitude: record.get('latitude'),
        longitude: record.get('longitude')
    });

    var info = this.details.child('#contact').child('#info');
    info.child('#photo').setData(record.data);
    info.child('#data').setData(record.data);

    this.getMainNav().push(this.details);
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function is only run if a record exists. If a record exists and the details panel does not, a new panel is created with the title &#8216;Details&#8217;. A child of the details panel is a map of the business, with id <em>detailMap</em>. Defining the map of the business as a variable, map, allows us to easily refer to it in subsequent commands. These commands set the zoom level, and set the center of the map to the latitude and longitude of the business. Defining the container of the Detail Panel that contains the info about the business, allows us to easily refer to it in subsequent commands. These commands set the data for the photo, and the data. As soon as the assingments are made, the main navigation brings the details view in the foreground from the right side of the screen. This is called a push transition.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>And here you have it. This is how the controller works in sync with the application&#8217;s model, store and views to run the application.</p>

<p>This concludes the four-part series that described the structure and the logic of a Sencha Touch application. I hope that this as well as my previous three posts will help you understand the explanations given in the <a href="http://vimeo.com/36420727">screencast</a> , where the CityBars application was originally developed using Sencha&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/designer/">Designer software</a>. The source code for the application is available <a href="http://img1.sencha.com/files/misc/citybars.xda.zip">here</a>.</p>
