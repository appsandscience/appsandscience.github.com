  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CityBars1.png"><img src="http://www.appsandscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CityBars1-207x300.png" alt="caption id=&quot;attachment_80&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; caption=&quot;The CityBars Sencha Touch Application&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>In the past three blog posts, I used the CityBars Sencha Touch application, to</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/making-sense-of-sencha-touch-the-citybars-app-views/">to define a few terms used in Sencha Touch development</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/the-structure-of-a-sencha-touch-application/">to explain the structure of a Sencha Touch application</a>, and</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/how-to-write-code-for-the-views-in-sencha-touch/">to demonstrate how the code for the graphical user interface is generated.</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>In this post I will describe how the application</p>

<ol>
<li><p>finds the user&#8217;s location,</p></li>
<li><p>searches Yelp for bars near the user, and</p></li>
<li><p>responds when the user taps on a with the bar that the user is interested in.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>All this logic is contained in a <em>controller</em> JavaScript file, under the controller subdirectory. The rest of this blog post will explain the various parts of the code in the controller file.</p>

<h3>How References and Controls work in the Controllers of Sencha Touch</h3>

<p>To be able to read the values of some interface elements, and to set or manipulate them, the controller needs a reference to them. Each reference within the controller is defined as a pair. For instance the list of bars in the ListContainer, has an id of <em>#datalist</em> (see <a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/how-to-write-code-for-the-views-in-sencha-touch/">my previous blog post</a> for a description of the views of the application.) This list of bars is referred to by the controller as dataList. The exact syntax is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('CityBars.controller.Business', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',

    config: {
        refs: {
            dataList: '#dataList',
            listCard: '#listCard',
            mainNav: 'mainnav',
            detailCard: '#detailCard'
        },

        control: {
            "#dataList": {
                itemtap: 'onListItemTap'
            }
        }
    },
</code></pre>

<p>In the code snippet above, the first line is used to define the controller&#8217;s name (Business) and to declare it as a controller, as opposed to a view, for instance. The config part of the code has two parts. The <em>refs</em> part that I referred to above and the control part, that I will explain in a bit. Notice the four of references.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first assigns the name <strong>dataList</strong> to the list component with id <strong>#datalist</strong> (note the # character).</p></li>
<li><p>The second assigns the name <strong>listCard</strong> to the list card for each bar, a card that has the id <strong>#listCard</strong> in the ListContainer.js file.</p></li>
<li><p>The third assings the name <strong>mainNav</strong> to the navigation panel <strong>mainav</strong> which is the navigation panel in the <em>MainNav.js</em>. Because the controller refers to the navigation view as a whole, no # is used before the name <strong>mainnav</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the element with id <strong>#detailCard</strong> gets a reference <strong>detailCard</strong> in the controller.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The controller can now refer to the four elements above and get their values or properties with function that Sencha Touch has implemented. These functions are called getters. For the <strong>datalist</strong> reference though, the application would like to respond when the user taps on it. For that reason a control needs to be defined. More specifically, the event that the controller is waiting for is <strong>itemtap</strong>. As soon as this event occurs, the function <strong>onListItemTap</strong> is executed. That function has to be defined by the user later on in the controller.</p>

<p>Now that the references and the controllers are set, the logic of the application has to be specified. But before any logic is introduced to respond to the tapping of an item, the application has to be able to find the user&#8217;s location and to find nearby bars.</p>

<h3>How Sencha Touch finds the user&#8217;s location</h3>

<p>Sencha Touch contains a few utilities that access the information that a phone can supply. In the case of geolocation, Sencha Touch uses <em>Ext.util.Geolocation</em>. The function to get the user&#8217;s location is called <strong>getLocation</strong> in this application, and it is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>getLocation: function(callback) {
    if (navigator &amp;&amp; navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
            callback(position);
        }, function(error) {
            alert('You are not connected to the Internet');
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The function above checks whether the user is connected to the internet, and if yes, it returns the user&#8217;s latitude and longitude.</p>

<h3>How Sencha Touch finds businesses near the user</h3>

<p>With the user&#8217;s location known, the application connects to Yelp and pulls that information. In order for this to happen however, the application needs to know the type of information that is going to be returned by Yelp, as well as the names of the fields that are returned. The information about the type of connection with Yelp is encapsulated in a Sencha Touch <strong>Store</strong> and the fields in a Sencha Touch <strong>Model</strong>. Models and stores go together, but let&#8217;s start with the store.</p>

<h4>The structure of a Sencha Touch Store</h4>

<p>The information about a store is kept in a file under the <em>store</em> directory. The contents of that file are shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('CityBars.store.BusinessStore', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Store',
    requires: [
        'CityBars.model.Business'
    ],

    config: {
        model: 'CityBars.model.Business',
        storeId: 'BusinessStore',
        proxy: {
            type: 'jsonp',
            reader: {
                type: 'json',
                rootProperty: 'businesses'
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>First, the store is given a name <em>BusinessStore</em> and declared as a store. Because the store always corresponds to a model, this is declared with the requires statement. The store is configured with the model that it is related to, an id is given to it for easy referencing, and information about the connection is displayed in the reader statement. Because the information is pulled from an external website (Yelp,) the type of the store is <strong>jsonp</strong>. Because the information is returned from Yelp as a JSON file, the reader of the file is of <strong>json</strong> type, and only everything under the <strong>businesses</strong> property is read.</p>

<h4>The structure of a Sencha Touch Model</h4>

<p>The information about a model is kept in a JavaScript file under the <em>model</em> directory. The contents of the file are shown below:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.define('CityBars.model.Business', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
    config: {
        fields: [
            {
                name: 'id',
                type: 'int'
            },
            {
                name: 'name'
            },
            {
                name: 'latitude'
            },
            {
                name: 'longitude'
            },
            {
                name: 'address1'
            },
            {
                name: 'address2'
            },
            {
                name: 'address3'
            },
            {
                name: 'phone'
            },
            {
                name: 'state_code'
            },
            {
                name: 'mobile_url'
            },
            {
                name: 'rating_img_url_small'
            },
            {
                name: 'photo_url'
            }
        ]
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This model is given a name, <em>Business</em>, and it is declared as a model. Then the fields served by the JSON file are described. They are id, name, latitude, longitude, etc. Those fields can be found on Yelp&#8217;s website.</p>

<h4>The init function in a Sencha Touch Controller</h4>

<p>Now that the model and the store for the application have been defined, the controller, can perform a search and serve the information to the user. This is done with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>init: function() {
    this.getLocation(function (location) {
        this.getBusinesses(location, function (store) {
            this.getDataList().setStore(store);
        });
    });
},
</code></pre>

<p>In the few lines of code above, a lot of logic for the application is contained. First, the function that is defined in the above lines is run when the controller is initialized, and that is as soon as the application launches. Each line after the first starts with <strong>this</strong>, a shortcut to the current controller. In other words, when the controller initializes, the <strong>getLocation</strong> function contained in the same file is run, then the <strong>getLocation</strong> function is run and finally the store for the <strong>dataList</strong> defined above is set to the store that was also defined above. With the sequence of these steps, the initial list of the application is populated with entries, and the controller is ready to respond to the user&#8217;s taps.</p>

<h3>How a Sencha Touch Controller responds to a user&#8217;s tap</h3>

<p>The function executed when a list item is tapped is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>onListItemTap: function(dataview, index, target, record, e, options) {
    if (record) {

        if (!this.details) {
            this.details = Ext.create('CityBars.view.DetailPanel', {
                title: 'Details'
            });
        }

        var map = this.details.child('#detailMap');
        map.setMapOptions({
            zoom: 17
        });
        map.setMapCenter({
            latitude: record.get('latitude'),
            longitude: record.get('longitude')
        });

        var info = this.details.child('#contact').child('#info');
        info.child('#photo').setData(record.data);
        info.child('#data').setData(record.data);

        this.getMainNav().push(this.details);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function is only run if a record exists. If a record exists and the details panel does not, a new panel is created with the title &#8216;Details&#8217;. A child of the details panel is a map of the business, with id <em>detailMap</em>. Defining the map of the business as a variable, map, allows us to easily refer to it in subsequent commands. These commands set the zoom level, and set the center of the map to the latitude and longitude of the business. Defining the container of the Detail Panel that contains the info about the business, allows us to easily refer to it in subsequent commands. These commands set the data for the photo, and the data. As soon as the assignments are made, the main navigation brings the details view in the foreground from the right side of the screen. This is called a push transition.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>And here you have it. This is how the controller works in sync with the application&#8217;s model, store and views to run the application.</p>

<p>This concludes the four-part series that described the structure and the logic of a Sencha Touch application. I hope that this as well as my previous three posts will help you understand the explanations given in this <a href="http://vimeo.com/36420727">screencast</a>, where the CityBars application was originally developed using Sencha&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/designer/">Designer software</a>. The source code for the application is available <a href="http://img1.sencha.com/files/misc/citybars.xda.zip">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous <a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/creating-an-iphone-application-with-javascript-the-sencha-touch-solution/">post</a>, I described the advantages of using Sencha Touch to develop applications for mobile platforms. In this post I would like to describe a few Sencha Touch concepts.</p>

<p>If you would like to see how a Sencha Touch application works, check out the <a href="http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/touch/examples/kitchensink/">kitchensink</a> application that has been created by the developers of Sencha Touch. You will be able to preview the JavaScript code that generates these views and you will be surprised by the relative short length of the code, at least compared to that necessary in Objective-C.</p>

<p>Some additional digging around might show you that it&#8217;s not very easy to program in Sencha Touch. Although Sencha Touch is easier to pick up compared to Objective-C, especially for web developers, the platform is not very straightforward. Mostly because of the complicated terminology used in Sencha Touch, and the dearth of books on the subject: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849515441/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=appsandscienc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1849515441">Sencha Touch Cookbook</a> is the only currently published book on Sencha Touch and it covers version 1.1, and not the current version 2.</p>

<p>This will be the first in a series of blog posts that aim to describe how to develop, build and deploy a mobile application using Touch 2. After you read this and the upcoming posts you will be able to</p>

<ul>
<li><p>understand several concepts of Sencha Touch,</p></li>
<li><p>follow along with <a href="http://vimeo.com/36420727">this</a></p></li>

<p>During the past few months, I spent countless hours studying Objective-C, the language used for iPhone and iPad app development. Just to give you an idea, the books and tutorials I have studied from include</p>

<ol>

</ol>


<p>All these books and tutorials taught me a lot about Objective-C but mostly that it is a very hard language to learn. In addition, Objective-C is only useful for developing iPhone/iPad applications. But how could I develop applications that can run on Android devices? Would I need to reprogram my apps in Java, the language used by Android? I was hoping that I could find a platform that could convert a single program into apps that can run on multiple operating systems (Apple, Android, even Blackberry) and multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, or the web). I was astonished to find out that many such languages exists (see the Wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_development#Platform_development_environment">Mobile Development</a> for an exhaustive list.)</p>

<p>Now my problem became which platform to choose. I experimented with several of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, I worked with <a href="http://www.canappi.com/">Canappi</a>. (See my <a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/creating-an-iphone-application-without-coding-the-tiggzi-solution/">blog post</a> for a detailed description.) Canappi uses a specialized language (MDSL) that can be used to generate Objective-C code. Unfortunately, the code that Canappi generates has includes deprecated statements, probably as a result of Canappi being the product of a single developer.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, I looked at <a href="http://www.canappi.com/">Tiggzi</a>. (See my <a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/creating-an-iphone-application-without-coding-the-tiggzi-solution/">blog post</a> for a detailed description.) Tiggzi uses a GUI that helps you create iPhone and Android applications without any coding. Tiggzi is a useful tool, but it&#8217;s not free and open-source.</p></li>
<li><p>I also looked at <a href="http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/">Corona SDK</a>, a platform that uses the scripting language Lua. Corona SDK is commonly used to develop 2D games, with several iPhone games on the app store, but not for business, data-driven applications.</p></li>
<li><p>I finally looked at ways of creating apps using HTML5 and its associated technologies, JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Although I briefly looked at Dreamweaver, I was turned off by its price. It was at that point that I looked into <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/sencha-touch-2-raising-the-bar/">Sencha Touch</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Sencha Touch is a JavaScript library built for the development of web applications that look native on mobile devices. After I read some of its <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/">documentation</a> and reviewed the <a href="http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/touch/examples/kitchensink/">kitchensink</a> application developed with Sencha Touch, I decided to spend some time to learn the platform. There are several advantages to Sencha Touch.</p>

<p>Sencha Touch</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is free and fast (especially its latest version.)</p></li>
<li><p>Simplifies the creation of nested views and the insertion of images on table entries.</p></li>
<li><p>Works with Phonegap but it also allows native packaging.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses the MVC (model-view-controller) architecture for code organization and reusability.</p></li>
<li><p>Aims to support Windows phones in the future.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Unfortunately, Sencha Touch, has a steep learning curve, like Objective-C, but unlike Objective-C, there are not that many books that describe its use, apart from the very useful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849515441/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=appsandscienc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1849515441">Sencha Touch Cookbook</a>, by Ajit Kumar.</p>

<p>I hope to slowly learn the platform in order to be able to quickly and robustly develop data driven applications. Future blog post will describe my progress in using Sencha Touch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past few weeks I have been experimenting with various tools that one can use to develop an iPhone/iPad application, without the need to program in Objective-C. In a previous blog post <a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/getting-started-on-app-development-with-a-little-help-from-canappi/">I described Canappi</a>, a tool that uses a specialized language, MDSL, to generate Objective-C code. In this post, I will describe <a href="http://www.tiggzi.com">Tiggzi</a>, a web service that creates native code for iPhone and Android applications using a coding-free graphical user interface. I will first describe the advantages and disadvantages of Tiggzi, and I will then share with you my recommendation about the service.</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Tiggzi does not require any coding. Dragging and dropping widgets on a canvas is the only thing that is required from a user of Tiggzi.</p></li>
<li><p>The applications created by Tiggzi can be be run on iPhones and iPads as well as on Android devices and mobile-phone browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating application screens is straightforward in Tiggzi, and transitioning between those screens is very easy. Also, each button, label, image can navigate to a new screen by selecting the appropriate settings.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very easy for a user to define and connect to REST services. Importing data using JSON, for instance, is very easy and the results of the queries can be easily included in a table view. This common task is handled very well in Tiggzi and a tutorial on Tiggzi&#8217;s website explains the process step-by-step.</p></li>
<li><p>The source code that Tiggzi generates is a collection of HTML and CSS files bundled with PhoneGap. That code can be edited in Apple&#8217;s XCode.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tiggzi website contains several well-presented tutorials that describe the creation of data-driven applications, which are common in business.</p></li>
<li><p>Tiggzi makes it very easy to share an application with testers and clients by supplying a custom URL with the HTML/CSS source code of the application. In the paid version, Tiggzi allows team members to collaborative on the creation of the applications.</p></li>
<li><p>For Android applications Tiggzi provides an app that runs the code generated by Tiggzi natively on the phone, even before the application is launched and submitted in the Android marketplace.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Despite its great number of advantages, Tiggzi may not be the platform that some developers may choose. That&#8217;s because the service has a few disadvantages.</p>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Tiggzi does not generate native GUI elements, at least for the iPhone that I tested it with. As a result, applications do not feel native. In addition, I had several problems using a table view, a common element in the business applications that I am interested in creating.</p></li>
<li><p>The service is not free. Tiggzi has several subscription levels but the free version provides a great feel for the service. (The free tier is currently limited to one project and on constructing three screens.)</p></li>
<li><p>A developer depends on the web-interface to create the application. That interface may change as a function of time. Although this might not be a disadvantage, provided that the interface improves.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Although Tiggzi has a lot of advantages, the lack of non-native GUI elements, might stop developers from using the service to create polished applications. However, Tiggzi provides a simple interface for creating apps and for sharing working prototypes with testers and clients.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Developing simple data-driven apps for the iPhone is not simple</strong>. Objective-C, the native language of the iPhone, is not easy, and accomplishing simple tasks with can be quite complicated.</p>

<p>I realized that when I tried to create a simple menu-driven application that catalogs all the Chemistry apps on the Apple store.</p>

<p>Just a bit of background: I have chosen to classify existing Chemistry apps in the following five categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Exam preparation</p></li>
<li><p>Chemistry-related calculators</p></li>
<li><p>Books</p></li>
<li><p>Reference works</p></li>
<li><p>Games</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now imagine an iPhone application that has a tab bar at the bottom with two tabs: One, called &#8220;Featured&#8221; and another called &#8220;Categories.&#8221; When you tap on one of the categories you can see a list of related apps, &#8220;App 1,&#8221; &#8220;App 2,&#8221; etc. When you tap on the &#8220;Featured&#8221; tab you can see a list of featured apps, &#8220;Featured App 1,&#8221; &#8220;Featured App 2,&#8221; etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you see more and more people carrying iPhones these days? I certainly do: Everywhere I look, I see iPhones, new and old. So what do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Are there more and more people using iPhones these days?</strong></p>

<p>I set out to answer this question and here&#8217;s what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>43% of the smartphones sold in October/November 2011 were iPhones</em>, according to a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/09/ios-marketshare-up-from-26-in-q3-to-43-in-octnov-2011/">report from TechChrunch</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>54% of the people surveyed who plan on buying a smartphone sometime between now and March, plan to buy an iPhone</em>, according to a <a href="http://www.changewaveresearch.com/articles/2012/smart_phones_20120109.html">report from ChangeWave Research</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These facts along with the permanently customer-filled Apple stores, the news that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2012/01/we-told-you-so-chinese-iphone-4s-launch-turns-into-egg-throwing-melee.ars">a riot almost broke in Beijing</a> the first day that iPhone 4S went on sale, and my constant noticing of people carrying iPhones, got me convinced: iPhones must be the most popular smartphones. That&#8217;s until I read the following <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/12/06/kindle_fire_eats_into_ipad_sales_lead_offset_by_global_iphone_demand.html">report from Apple Insider</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Apple&#8217;s share of the smartphone market is 18%, below that of Samsung at 19%.</strong></p>

<p>So?</p>

<p><strong>How come there seem to be so many iPhones despite their 18% market share?</strong></p>

<p>I am not a marketer or a consumer psychologist, but here are five reasons why you may notice more and more people with iPhones:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>There&#8217;s only one iPhone but hundreds of Android phones</strong>: Because there is only one iPhone, but hundreds of Samsung phones, it is easier to recognize an iPhone. This behavior might be related to what social theorist Barry Schwartz calls <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060005696/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=appsandscienc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060005696">the paradox of choice</a>: more choices are not necessarily better.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apple aggressively advertises its products</strong>: When Apple announces a new device, everybody knows about it: the media, the bloggers, everybody. So after such a barrage of information, when you see a new Apple device, you recognize it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apple aggressively places its products in movies</strong>: Apple products are aggressively placed in popular movies, about 30% of them in 2010, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/22/apple_products_appeared_in_30_of_all_top_movies_in_2010.html">according to Apple Insider</a>. Apple products are placed more frequently in movies than those of Nike or Ford.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The iPhone 4S was introduced in October</strong>: Happy owners of the new iPhone 4S were busy playing with their device, effectively displaying it more frequently to friends and strangers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The iPhone has become a very popular camera</strong>: At least for Flickr users, the iPhone is the most popular camera. And there is no easier way for people to display their iPhones than when they take it out to take a picture, especially during the holiday season.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So what do you think? <strong>How do you explain that there seem to be so many iPhones around despite their 18% market share?</strong> Share your opinion in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.appsandscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/iphone.jpg"><img src="http://www.appsandscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/iphone-300x225.jpg" alt="caption id=&quot;attachment_23&quot; align=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; caption=&quot;Image: Salvatore Vuono / FreeDigitalPhotos.net&quot;" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The first question that I had when I started with iPhone/iPad app development was what hardware was necessary for the job. Could I develop my apps on Windows or, even better, could I do it using my Linux machine? And would I need to buy an iPad in addition to the iPhone that I already owned?</p>

<p>After I did a lot of of research these are the answers that I found:</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>You need an Intel-based Mac. The alternatives are for the adventurous</h3>

<p>If you google &#8220;hardware for iPhone development&#8221; you will find that the only hardware that is <em>sanctioned</em> by Apple to develop apps is an Intel-based Macintosh. That means that Apple does not make Windows or Linux versions of XCode, its integrated development environment (IDE) that is used for app development.</p>

<p>Given that I have been a Linux and Windows user for years, I thought that there must have been some alternatives for these operating systems. So I some did extensive research, and here&#8217;s the bottom line: <strong>In order to focus my energy on developing applications, and not on troubleshooting operating system issues, I needed an Intel-based Mac</strong>.</p>

<p>If you cannot afford to buy an Intel-based Mac however, there are a few alternatives. Here are the two about which I have learned a little bit about:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>If you are NOT interested in submitting your applications to the Apple app store, you don&#8217;t need XCode</strong>. In that case, you can compile and debug your apps with an alternative IDE, test them on a jailbroken iPhone, and submit them to Cydia, a repository of applications for jailbroken iPhones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you are interested in submitting your applications to the Apple app store, you need XCode, and the Mac operating system (Mac OS)</strong>. It is possible to install the Mac OS on non-Apple hardware, by using one of the following two methods, neither of which is sanctioned by Apple:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* You can put together a Hackintosh, a non-Apple computer that runs Mac OS. Only certain non-Apple computers can be "converted" into Hackintoshes.


* You can patch the commercial software VMware Workstation, and obtain a modified installation disk of Mac OS. Both actions may be legally questionable. But if you
</code></pre>

<p>choose to go that route, the non-Apple hardware and the host operating system (Windows or Linux) must supports virtualization.</p>

<h3>You need to choose your Intel-based Mac carefully</h3>

<p>You may consider buying a used Mac to save some money. That was my first thought when I found out the price of new Macs. But you have to be careful. You should make sure that the used computer runs the latest version of the operating system. The reason is that Apple has a &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; attitude towards its app store and tightly controls app development. For instance, Apple makes the latest version of XCode run on only the latest two versions of Mac OS; And you do want the latest version of XCode because each new version makes app development easier.</p>

<p>You should also be careful about the size of the hard disk of your Mac. Flash-based disks are much faster than conventional ones but they are also much smaller for the price. If you are considering using your Mac as your main computer, you may need some additional space on your hard disk.</p>

<h3>You need to have have an iPhone and/or an iPad</h3>

<p>Although XCode comes with a iPhone/iPad simulator, it is extremely useful to have the actual iOS devices to test your applications on. If you are planning to develop apps for only the iPhone or only for the iPad, you don&#8217;t need to have both.</p>

<h3>Relax and enjoy Apple&#8217;s tight control of app development</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, Apple tightly controls the hardware and the software that is necessary to develop apps for its mobile devices. In addition, not all apps that have been developed on Apple&#8217;s hardware and with Apple&#8217;s software are approved by Apple. It turns out for an app to get approved it has to follow strict guidelines for design and architecture.</p>

<p>Such control however, come with some advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Apple is making available its innovative software development products to those who follow the company&#8217;s strict guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>If your app is approved, there is very little that you have to do to market it. Apple does all the work for you, and the users will chose it if it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p></li>
<li><p>iPhone and iPad users already trust Apple to approve useful and beautiful apps. Therefore users are more willing to invest on such apps.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, I have not been able to find anyone who claims to have developed an iPhone/iPad application by using a method that is not sanctioned by Apple.</p>

<p>So after a lot of thought and research, I begrudgingly bought a Mac. My Mac has now become my main work computer and because its operating system is based on Unix BSD, my transition from Linux has been very smooth. And, I almost hate to say it, I like my new Mac.</p>

<p><em>Have you developed apps that are featured in the App store without Apple&#8217;s sanctioned hardware and software? If yes, please share your experience in the comments.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to the Apps and Science blog! <strong>This blog will document my progress towards learning how to create a science app</strong> for the iPhone and the iPad.</p>

<p><strong>I am a chemist with some knowledge of programming</strong> but with a great interest in creating science apps. Thinking that &#8220;it can&#8217;t be that hard to create an app,&#8221; I got started reading about app development in December, 2011. <strong>I hope to develop my own science app by June, 2012</strong>.</p>

<p>The blog will not only document my progress but it <strong>will also provide answers to the following questions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the types of science apps that exist on the Apple store?</p></li>
<li><p>What apps are there for Chemistry, Physics, and Biology?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I review existing science apps?</p></li>
<li><p>How hard is it to create an app?</p></li>
<li><p>What hardware do I need to create an app?</p></li>
<li><p>What computer language should I learn in order to develop an app?</p></li>
<li><p>What books teach app development?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I do advanced math on an Apple device?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I promote my app?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I expect to make money from making apps?</p></li>
