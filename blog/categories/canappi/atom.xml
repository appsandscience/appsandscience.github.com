    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Developing simple data-driven apps for the iPhone is not simple</strong>. Objective-C, the native language of the iPhone, is not easy, and accomplishing simple tasks with can be quite complicated.</p>

<p>I realized that when I tried to create a simple menu-driven application that catalogs all the Chemistry apps on the Apple store.</p>

<p>Just a bit of background: I have chosen to classify existing Chemistry apps in the following five categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Exam preparation</p></li>
<li><p>Chemistry-related calculators</p></li>
<li><p>Books</p></li>
<li><p>Reference works</p></li>
<li><p>Games</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now imagine an iPhone application that has a tab bar at the bottom with two tabs: One, called "Featured" and another called "Categories." When you tap on one of the categories you can see a list of related apps, "App 1," "App 2," etc. When you tap on the "Featured" tab you can see a list of featured apps, "Featured App 1," "Featured App 2," etc.</p>
